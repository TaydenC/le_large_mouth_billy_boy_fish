* Tried to get PC headphone output to drive old Billy speaker
** This doesn't work - as
** https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/toneMelody shows the use of the same speaker direct from Arduino
  * Use a resister like https://startingelectronics.org/beginners/start-electronics-now/tut7-arduino-melody/

2023-08-20 Integration
* Combined the sound_sensor_example and mouth-tests-via-motor-shield into integration-audio-and-motor-tests
* Next: improve the code to oscilate mouth less often, and get the speaker to work.

2023-08-20 Sound Sensor test
* Downloaded Mega 2560 examples kit from
* Started Sound Sensor Example.ino (exercise 20)
* Ran the Serial Plotter
* Altered potiometer to adjust digital detection threshold. This flashes the LED when it detects music playing
* The sound sensor has a built in microphone, and no audio 

2023-08-19
* Circuit does not detect changes in audio 

2023-08-16
* Couldn't find past notes, so made new diagrams and a github project
* Started audio-detection-test.ino

2023-08-13
* Started mouth-tests-via-motor-shield.ino
* Resumed project. Where did we keep stuff? Starting again.
